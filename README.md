It's a desktop application made with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs).

Credits to [Fireship.io](https://fireship.io/) for the tutorial!

I used [electron-forge](https://www.electronforge.io/) to build the foundation of the project.

To create the electron app that is executable in your own OS using npm:

```sh
$ cd desktop-screen-recorder
$ npm run make
```

or if you have yarn:

```sh
$ yarn make
```
